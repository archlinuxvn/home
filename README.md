## DESCRIPTION

  This repository contains the source code of ArchLinuxVn's homepage.

  This repository is only a mirror. To build the page, you must use `nanoc`.

  To contribute to the project, please read the article (in Vietnamese)
    http://archlinuxvn.tuxfamily.org/vn/author-guide/ .

## BUILD

  To build the site and see its output, you need `Ruby-1.9` and some
  Ruby gems: `nanoc`, `asdf`, `fssm`, `kramdown`. Use the command `nanoc`
  to build the page, and the command `nanoc view` to start a temporary
  web server at the address <http://localhost:3000>. Accessing to this
  address will give you an offline copy of ArchLinuxVn's homepage.
