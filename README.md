This repository is only a mirror. To build the page, you must use `nanoc`.

## Build

To build the site and see its output, you need `Ruby-1.9` and some
Ruby gems: `nanoc`, `adsf`, `fssm`, `kramdown`, `coderay`, `nokogiri`.

Use the command `nanoc` to build the page, and `nanoc view` to start a
temporary web server at at <http://localhost:3000>. Accessing to this
